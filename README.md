# Random Blocks

This plugin includes some shiny blocks to make Gutenberg a bit more functional.

## Business Hours

The Business Hours block lets you specify your opening and closing hours each day, and then displays them on the front end.  The current day is indicated, as well as giving an estimate of how long until the store opens or closes.

## Phone Number

The Phone Number block lets you specify the country code and phone number to reach you at, and renders to a `tel:` link on the front-end.  It is easily styleable to match your theme, and should make it easier for customers to click to contact you.
